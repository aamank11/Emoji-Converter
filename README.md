This was a fun start on learning to use Python Dictionary's. I was able to use faces made by keys on a keyboard and convert them into emojis. The user is prompted to say anything using a face made with keys and the message said by the user will be repeated along with the conversion of the emoji. The newer file is a different version of the same code where I instead used a emoji converter function to recieve the same output.
